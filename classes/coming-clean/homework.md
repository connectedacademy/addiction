## The Self-Portrait

Create an image or series of images that are in some way autobiographical. It doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be a picture of your face, the contents of you pocket could say more about you than what you look like. Add a title and or caption to the image that adds another layer of meaning beyond the purely visual.

## How it works
Once you submit a link to your image below you will be entered into a private group discussion where you should receive feedback on your submission. Check back regularly to respond to feedback.

Other people's submissions will also appear on the left and we encourage you to leave comments on their work too. The more feedback you leave, the more you will receive.

## What you need

- A camera to capture your image
- A place to post your submission (e.g. website or blog)
