## The Participatory Portrait

Working with a subject create a collaborative image whereby the subject has a meaningful voice in how it is constructed. Ask them to contribute a caption or record a short interview which you bundle into the final piece.

## How it works
Once you submit a link to your image below you will be entered into a private group discussion where you should receive feedback on your submission. Check back regularly to respond to feedback.

Other people's submissions will also appear on the left and we encourage you to leave comments on their work too. The more feedback you leave, the more you will receive.

## What you need

- A camera to capture your image
- A place to post your submission (e.g. website or blog)
